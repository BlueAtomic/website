                <span class="text-expression">Our mission at Wolfsvale is to provide the market with more FOSS products.</span>
                We want to ensure that <span class="text-expression">everyone</span> gets a chance, and would like to offer these chances by filling the gaps on the market.
                We do not discriminate. We will make anything in our grasp for everyone in a cost-effective, yet effective manner.
                We will also always maintain the software we produce. Created by a software development student, <span class="text-expression">Wolfsvale Software aims to learn, and to teach others.</span>
                This way we can give the knowledge we have to others, and provide it in a meaningful way. We are a dutch company, and conform to the european laws.
                All our developers with exception to the founder are volunteers.
